# Single expression Python
Everybody knows that the less lines of code to read, the better. POL takes this notion to the extreme!

# Documentation

Below is documentation for each of the files in this repo, because I want to keep each of these genuinely 1 line of code. The format is as follows:
```
Title of feature/animation/etc.
Author/source
Characters used
```

_An exception is made for the `_______Format.py` files for the sake of providing readable examples of the Tkinter framework_
